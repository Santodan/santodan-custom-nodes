# Santodan Custom Nodes for ComfyUI

This is a standalone ComfyUI custom node for **randomizing LoRAs** with adjustable strength and support for automatic trigger word injection.

> ‚úÖ Now compatible with [ComfyUI-Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager) for one-click install!

## üé≤ Randomize LoRAs Node

The **Randomize LoRAs** node lets you experiment by randomly selecting LoRAs from a list and assigning randomized strengths. You can enable exclusive selection (just one LoRA) or allow multiple LoRAs to be mixed.

Additionally, if the LoRA includes trigger words (via `lora-info`), these are extracted and returned for use in prompts.

### üîß Node Inputs

- `lora_name_X`: Up to 10 LoRAs to pick from (slots 1‚Äì10)
- `min_strength_X`: Minimum strength when a LoRA is selected
- `max_strength_X`: Maximum strength
- `exclusive_mode`:
  - **On** ‚Äì choose 1 LoRA only
  - **Off** ‚Äì choose a random number from the list
- `stride`: Number of runs before re-randomizing (not currently enforced)
- `force_randomize_after_stride`: Avoids repeating same LoRA set (partially supported)
- `refresh_loras`: Dummy input to trigger updates in the UI
- `lora_stack`: (Optional) Input for chaining or merging with existing LoRA stack

---

### üì§ Node Outputs

- `LORA_STACK`: A list of `(name, min_strength, max_strength)` tuples
- `Trigger Words`: Comma-separated string of trigger words for selected LoRAs
- `Help Text`: Describes the meaning of each setting for reference
